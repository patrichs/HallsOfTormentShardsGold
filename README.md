# HallsOfTormentShardsGold

Just a quick C# program that allows you to set your gold & torment shards in Halls of Torment 2024-10-11. Make sure you are in game with a character (as in, you have entered a stage). Then set your gold & torment shards, and exit back to camp. That's it. Setting shards without unlocking the scribe probably does nothing or crashes the game so I wouldn't do that.
